# ResoCoder's Flutter TDD Clean Architecture course.
Updated code and libs from ResoCoder's Flutter TDD Clean Architecture project course.

This project provides a good refresher on clean arc with a heavy emphasis of TDD. The updates for this project are as follows:
- asynchronous fold;
- replace disptach method to add;
- replace RaisedButton to ElevatedButton;
- update mockito test code for null safety type system. See [Mockito null safety](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito/blob/master/NULL_SAFETY_README.md);
- onSubmitted removed;
- clean inputString on TriviaControls: it was being unintentionally cached after each request;
